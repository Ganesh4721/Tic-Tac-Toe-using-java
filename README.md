## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.There is no universally agreed rule as to who plays first, but in this article the convention that X plays first is used.
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game which is built in Java.

## Rules of the Game
- The game is to be played between two people (in this program between HUMAN and COMPUTER).
- One of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells.
- The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’).
- If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.

## 🎈 Development <a name="development"></a>
1. We can run the game one player can be enter manually and another we can enter rand() method.
2. We can connect the progarm to visualize by using the java swing.
3. We can visualize the output in the console by creating the design file where we can show the output.
